# Model Evaluation

* Model evaluation is how you measure the capability of your model to predict new data.
* It's essential because it tells you how trustworthy your model is beyond the information it was trained on.
* This step comes after training, where you use specific metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall) to assess how well your model performs.

## Over-fitting, Under-fitting, and Model Selection

* Over-fitting is when your model learns your training data too well, including its noise and outliers,which means it performs poorly on new, unseen data.
* Under-fitting happens when your model is too simple to learn the underlying pattern of the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing datasets.

Model selection involves balancing between these two extremes. It requires choosing a model and setting its hyperparameters (configuration settings) so that it generalizes well to new data – not too simple and not too complex.

## Ridge Regression

*Ridge Regression is a technique used to enhance the generalization of your model. 
It adds a penalty to the size of the coefficients to avoid over-fitting. 
This penalty forces the model to keep the coefficients (the importance it assigns to each feature) relatively small, 
making it less likely to rely too heavily on any single feature and thereby improving its ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

## Grid Search

* Grid Search is a method for selecting the best set of hyperparameters for your model.
* You define a “grid” of possible combinations of hyperparameters and then systematically train and evaluate models for each combination to find the one that performs best.
* It’s like conducting a series of experiments to discover the optimal recipe that makes your model perform at its best.

## Practical Application

To practically apply these concepts, ensure you:

* Split your data into training and testing sets. This enables you to train your model on one set of data and test its performance on a completely separate set of data.
* Consider using cross-validation, particularly when your dataset isn’t large, to better estimate the performance of your model.
* Implement Ridge Regression and Grid Search as techniques to combat over-fitting and find the best model configuration, respectively.
