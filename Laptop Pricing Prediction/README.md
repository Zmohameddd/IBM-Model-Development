# Laptop Pricing Prediction 

## Overview

* This project focuses on predicting laptop prices based on key attributes using various regression techniques. 
* Starting with simple linear regression, we progress to multiple linear regression, polynomial regression,
* and finally a pipeline combining scaling, polynomial features, and linear regression for enhanced modeling accuracy.

### Project Structure
* Data Exploration:
Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the attributes and relationships.
### Task 1: Single Linear Regression:
Utilizing the 'CPU_frequency' attribute to predict prices with a simple linear regression model.
### Task 2: Multiple Linear Regression:
Building a multiple linear regression model using multiple laptop attributes.
### Task 3: Polynomial Regression:
Applying polynomial regression to predict prices based on 'CPU_frequency' with different degrees.
### Task 4: Pipeline Implementation:
Creating a pipeline incorporating scaling, polynomial features, and linear regression for a comprehensive model.
## Key Concepts
### Evaluation Metrics:
* R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to assess model performance.
* Model Comparison:
Analyzing the effectiveness of different regression techniques for laptop pricing prediction.
Structured Approach:
The project follows a systematic workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.
Dataset

The dataset comprises attributes like CPU frequency, RAM, storage, GPU, and more, influencing the pricing of laptops.

### Libraries Used
* pandas, numpy: Data handling and numerical operations.
* scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and pipelines.
* seaborn, matplotlib: Data visualization tools.
